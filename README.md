Basic Description

The main purpose of this platform is to provide free education to all.
It will be a community platform on which anyone can share his/her knowledge related to the topic mentioned by admin team.
For Eg: 
      
      Admin team will mention the complete CBSE course for 1st to 12th class and any community member can share his skills in
      video lecture format or by sharing the practice questions for the same. For now project is targeting SSC and other
      competetive exams practice and learning and slowly we will move towards free education for various standards.

The project is divided into three sections:

      Practice section
      Daily Test section
      Weekly Test section
      
Practice Section : This section will be having brief explanation of each and every topic along with some practice questions.
                   A user will be able to select the subject from 4 different subjects and than can navigate to the
                   desired chapter that they want to learn. We will analyse each and every question solved by him in the 
                   practice section and user can see his performance. Through this functionality he will get the proper idea of
                   his capabiltiy of solving questions.
                   
Daily Test Section: This section will be dedicated to check the user's performance within time frame. A mock test based on
                    pattern of SSC exam will be provided to the user on daily basis and it will help him in setting up his
                    temprament for the exam. Similar to the practice section we will also analyse his performance in daily tests
                    and give him a proper performance chart and a rough idea about his capability of solving questions within
                    a given time frame.
                    
Weekly Test Section: This section will be similar to the daily test based section but it will be a little advanced and
                     final performance of user will be depend on this test. We will release performance chart every week in
                     which highest priority will be given to this section.
