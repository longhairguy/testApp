# Basic Description

## END GOAL
     #### The main purpose of this platform is to provide free education to all.
     ##### It will be a community platform on which anyone can come up and practise for their exams by following different practise path provided.

## Intial Phase
### Intially we are targetting SSC (Staff Selection Commision) Examination .
### Here Students can come up make their account and can do practise for their exam for free of cost.

## Practise Trials
### The project is divided into three sections:

      * Practice section
      * Daily Test section
      * Weekly Test section
      * Daily Learning
      
Practice Section : This section will be having brief explanation of each and every topic along with some practice questions.
                   A user will be able to select the subject from 4 different subjects and than can navigate to the
                   desired chapter that they want to learn. We will analyse each and every question solved by him in the 
                   practice section and user can see his performance. Through this functionality he will get the proper idea of
                   his capabiltiy of solving questions.
                   
Daily Test Section: This section will be dedicated to check the user's performance within time frame. A mock test based on
                    pattern of SSC exam will be provided to the user on daily basis and it will help him in setting up his
                    temprament for the exam. Similar to the practice section we will also analyse his performance in daily tests
                    and give him a proper performance chart and a rough idea about his capability of solving questions within
                    a given time frame.
                    
Weekly Test Section: This section will be similar to the daily test based section but it will be a little advanced and
                     final performance of user will be depend on this test. We will release performance chart every week in
                     which highest priority will be given to this section.

## What we are Analyzing and Depicting in Graphs
1. Time Taken To Solve Single Problem
2. Number of Attempts he/she takes to solve a particular question 
3. Area-wise Rank in Weekly and Daily Test 
4. Country Rank in Weekly Test
